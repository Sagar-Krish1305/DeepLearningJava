# DeepLearningJava

## Overview
DeepLearningJava is a Java-based project for implementing deep learning algorithms and models. The repository includes code and examples for training and testing neural networks on tasks such as Image classification using the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Implementation of neural networks in Java from Scratch
- Example of training a model on the MNIST dataset
- XOR problem solver example

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sagar-Krish1305/DeepLearningJava.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Build the project and resolve dependencies.

## Usage
### Running the XOR Example
2. Run `CheckingEXOR.java` to see the XOR problem solution.

### Training on MNIST Dataset
2. Run `MNISTSolver.java` to train and test the neural network on the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure
- `MNIST`: Contains Image Data for training and testing models on the MNIST dataset.
- `NeuralNetworks`: Contains code for neural network implementation and XOR problem solver.
- `out`: Output directory for compiled classes.
- `CheckingEXOR.java`: Example code for solving `XOR problem`.
- `MNISTSolver.java`: Example code for training and testing on MNIST dataset.
